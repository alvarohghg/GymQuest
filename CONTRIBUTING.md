# GymQuest contributing guide 📖💪 <!-- omit in toc -->
Firstly, we want to thank you for considering contributing to our project, since it's the people like you who make the app grow better!

We are open to **any type of contribution** such as:

 - Proposing pull request to improve the code
 - Submitting bug/issues reports
 - Making suggestions
 - Making questions in the issue section (search to see if someone else didn't ask the same question before!)
 - Opening a discussion 

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README.md).

## Getting started

### Submitting code
Any code change should be submitted as a pull request, with a description explaining what the code does and the steps to execute it.

### Pull Request
When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, a Docs team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Code review process

The bigger the pull request, the longer it will take to review and merge. Try to break down large pull requests in smaller chunks that are easier to review and merge. It is also always helpful to have some context for your pull request. What was the purpose? Why does it matter to you?

### Issues
You can create an issue for reporting **problems**/**bugs** that you may have found in the code or simply for making **questions** that could be useful to know for you and the rest of the users.

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the docs, **search if an issue already exists**. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/github/docs/issues/new/choose).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/github/docs/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. 
### Discussion
Here you can contribute by proposing ideas to add new features that you find useful, proposing topics to talk about, keeping up to date with the latest news about the app or participating in the polls!
